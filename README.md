# Buddies

Finding reliable group members to work on a project you’re passionate about isn’t always easy. This doesn’t only apply to people in online university, other project building enthusiasts who didn’t have the funds to go university have even less connections to people in their field, so finding reliable people with similar interests becomes even harder. 

The aim of this project is to provide an app that serves as a funneling station for people to come and look for group partners.
